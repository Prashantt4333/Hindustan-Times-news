        <p>Even though KL Rahul is regarded as India's first-choice opener, the premier batter is embracing judicial scrutiny around his batting performances in the lead-up to the upcoming edition of the ICC World T20. Reflecting on Rahul's performance against Australia in the recently concluded T20I series,<br/> 
            legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has come out in the support of the under-fire batter.

            Throwing weight behind Rahul ahead of the South Africa series, former Indian skipper Gavaskar pointed out that the premier batter sacrificed his wicket for the team in the last two T20Is against the Men from the Down Under.

"Well, he was doing what the team was expecting him to do which was both the times, you saw he got a fifty in the first game but in the second game, where he had to throw the bat from the first ball because it was an 8-overs-a-side game, he sacrificed his wicket for the team," Gavaskar told Star Sports.
